# Competitive Programming Solutions

Welcome to my repository of competitive programming solutions! This collection includes solutions to problems I've solved on **Codeforces**, primarily in **C++** and **Python**, with a focus on problems involving strings and matrices.

## Why This Repository is Unique

Unlike many other repositories that only provide code, I have taken extra care to include **simple explanations** for the problems and, where necessary, explanations for the solutions themselves. This makes it easier for other learners to understand the logic behind the code and the approach to solving the problem, especially for tricky or advanced problems.

- **Problem Explanations**: For each problem, a brief and easy-to-understand explanation is included. This helps clarify the problem statement, especially when the official description might be complex or difficult to grasp.
- **Solution Explanations**: For problems that require extra clarification, I've provided explanations for my approach and how the solution works, highlighting key steps like optimization strategies, edge cases, or unique algorithms used.

## Topics Covered

The repository includes solutions for a wide variety of problems, with explanations for topics such as:

- **String Manipulation**: Problems involving pattern matching, substrings, palindromes, etc.
- **Matrix Operations**: Common algorithms on matrices such as searching, traversal, and dynamic programming on matrices.
- **Dynamic Programming**: Solutions to problems involving state optimization using dynamic programming.
- **Greedy Algorithms**: Efficient, intuitive approaches to problems where making the optimal choice at each step yields the correct result.
- **Mathematics and Number Theory**: Solutions covering prime numbers, modular arithmetic, GCD/LCM, and more.
- **Graph Algorithms**: BFS, DFS, shortest paths, and other graph-related problems.
- **Recursion and Backtracking**: Solutions for problems involving recursive strategies and exploration of possible configurations.

## Repository Structure

- All solutions are in the root of the repository.
- File names are based on the **problem name** or **problem ID** on Codeforces, so you can easily search for them using the GitHub search bar.
- **C++** and **Python** are the main languages used.

## How to Use

1. **Clone** this repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/competitive-programming-solutions.git

   ```

2. If you only want a specific solution just copy the raw file and paste it in your IDE.
